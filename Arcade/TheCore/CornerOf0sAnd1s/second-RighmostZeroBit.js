Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.
Presented with the integer n, find the 0-based position of the second rightmost zero bit in its binary representation (it is guaranteed that such a bit exists), counting from right to left.

Return the value of 2position_of_the_found_bit.
